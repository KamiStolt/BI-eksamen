# BI-eksamen

Problem Statement
Which country had the lowest COVID-19 death toll, and what factors such as age, welfare, healthcare, and population structure can help explain the differences in death rates between countries?

Purpose
The COVID-19 pandemic impacted countries in very different ways, with significant variation in death tolls. In this project, we aim to identify the country with the lowest death toll and compare it to other countries to investigate which factors such as age, welfare, and healthcare may have contributed to the differences in outcomes.


Hypotheses 

1. Factors such as population size, society, and welfare systems play a role in the COVID-19 death rate between two very similar countries.

2. The Nordic countries had higher survival rates during COVID-19 compared to other countries.

3. Age and gender has a major impact on the survival rate during COVID-19. 

4. A strong healthcare system has a positive effect on the COVID-19 death rate.

5. What kind of impact does the Covid-19 have on our immune system now? 



Which challenge you would like to address?
We aim to analyze COVID-19-related death rates in order to identify the most influential factors contributing to mortality during the pandemic. Based on these insights, we seek to predict which precautions or interventions could be most effective in the event of a future epidemic.


Why is this challenge important or interesting research goal?
A deeper understanding of the key factors that significantly influenced COVID-19 death rates can provide valuable insights for public health authorities and policymakers. By identifying these critical drivers, governments can better prepare for and respond to future pandemics or public health emergencies, potentially saving lives and optimizing resource allocation.


What is the expected solution your project would provide?
We expect to present the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic through relevant visualizations and an interactive web application that enables users to explore and understand the underlying data.


What would be the positive impact of the solution, which category of users could benefit from it?
While the solution may benefit a broad audience, our primary focus is on delivering actionable insights to public health authorities and policymakers. By providing them with clear, data-driven overviews, we aim to support more informed decisions in managing future health crises.

3. Prepare the development environment

plan and organise the execution of the individual tasks in terms of time, milestones, deliverables, team members engagement
 We will do our best throughout the project, but we understand that life outside the project will affect how much we can contribute.
We will use collaborative programming (taking turns sharing screens) and divide individual tasks.
All three of us are also working on our System Development exam project at the same time.
Additionally, all group members have children, which requires flexibility and understanding.
We will primarily focus on the BI exam project on Mondays and Thursdays.
